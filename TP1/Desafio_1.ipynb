      "\n",
      "One piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\n",
      "that no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\n",
      "buried. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\n",
      "resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\n",
      "claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\n",
      "Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\n",
      "Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\n",
      "that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\n",
      "in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\n",
      "interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n",
      "\n",
      "The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\n",
      "Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\n",
      "requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\n",
      "are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\n",
      "mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\n",
      "took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\n",
      "allow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\n",
      "on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\n",
      "did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\n",
      "The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\n",
      "whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\n",

      "insane.\n",
      "\n",
      "     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\n",

      "that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\n",
      "step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\n",
      "described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\n",
      "to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\n",
      "permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\n",
      "very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\n",
      "hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\n",
      "people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\n",
      "shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\n",
      "there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\n",
      "lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\n",
      "There were no shots coming back from the government side.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\n",
      "asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\n",
      "I was given were the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\n",
      "federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\n",
      "quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\n",
      "needed in other parts of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\n",
      "never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\n",
      "that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\n",
      "be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\n",
      "members to come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\n",
      "to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\n",
      "the passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\n",
      "the children who were still inside the compound were being abused\n",
      "significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\n",
      "unsafe conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\n",
      "The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\n",
      "given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\n",
      "evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\n",
      "that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\n",
      "convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\n",
      "increase with the passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The third question I asked was, has the military been\n",
      "consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\n",
      "that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\n",
      "that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\n",
      "people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\n",
      "of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\n",
      "military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\n",
      "had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\n",
      "minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\n",
      "-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\n",
      "significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\n",
      "said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\n",
      "should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\n",
      "today.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Q  Mr. President --\n",
      "\n",
      "     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\n",
      "reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\n",
      "trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\n",
      "\n",
      "     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\n",
      "reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\n",
      "reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\n",
      "add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\n",
      "late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\n",
      "had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\n",
      "custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\n",
      "to unfold.\n",
      "\n",
      "     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\n",
      "speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\n",
      "on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\n",
      "I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\n",
      "King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\n",
      "is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\n",
      "happen when the federal government is in control.\n",
      "\n",
      "     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\n",
      "would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\n",
      "Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\n",
      "murdered themselves.  (Applause.)\n",
      "\n",
      "     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\n",
      "life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\n",
      "people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\n",
      "heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\n",
      "and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\n",
      "avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\n",
      "themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\n",
      "children.\n",
      "\n",
      "     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\n",
      "is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\n",
      "to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\n",
      "you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\n",
      "said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\n",
      "children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\n",
      "unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\n",
      "with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\n",
      "that.  So that is where I think things stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\n",
      "mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\n",
      "patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\n",
      "decide that way?\n",
      "\n",
      "     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\n",
      "is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\n",
      "done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\n",
      "time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\n",
      "World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\n",
      "to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\n",

      "the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\n",
      "some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\n",
      "totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\n",
      "evidence we have.\n",
